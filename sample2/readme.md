# GP tools for AWS Sample 2

This sample uses AWS EMR to generate a map based on web log analysis results. 

The log samples included in this sample are extracted from ArcGIS Online logs, for simplicity they have been cleaned and formated in a csv file. Hadoop is recommended for analysis of very large log files, and to get optimal performance it's recommended that you partition your data. The sample includes, the directory strucutre for data, and the script includes the hive command to apply partitioning.  

Result points generated by the hive script are visualized in [ArcGIS Desktop](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgis-for-desktop) to generate the map.
